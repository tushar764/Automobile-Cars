ðŸš— Automobile System
Project Overview
The Automobile System is a web application that provides detailed information about various cars while ensuring secure user authentication using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). It implements a robust login and registration system with  enhanced security.

Key Features
âœ… Secure Authentication â€“ Ensures user identity verification before granting access.
âœ… User Management â€“ Supports secure login and registration with Two-Factor Authentication.
âœ… Car Descriptions â€“ Displays detailed information about different cars.

Components
User Registration & Authentication
Secure login with 2FA authentication.
Backend Development (Express.js & Node.js)
Uses Express.js to manage API routes for authentication.
Encrypts user credentials for added security.
Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth and interactive user experience.
Uses form handling for user input validation and authentication flow.
Database (MongoDB)
Stores user data securely using MongoDB.
Ensures data integrity with proper validation and encryption techniques.
Security Enhancements
ðŸ”’ bcrypt.js for password hashing.
ðŸ”’ JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.
ðŸ”’ Middleware Authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Implement SMS-based OTP verification.
ðŸ”¹ Add multi-user roles with different authentication levels.
