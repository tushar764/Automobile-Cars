                    <p class="lead">Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) is a safety feature in modern cars designed to prevent or reduce the severity of collisions. It uses sensors like radar, cameras, or lasers to detect potential obstacles in the vehicleâ€™s path. If the system determines that a collision is imminent, it can automatically apply the brakes to slow down or stop the car, helping avoid accidents.</p>

                    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1"> Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) <span class="text-body-secondary"></span></h2>
                    <p class="lead">Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is an advanced driver assistance feature that helps keep the vehicle centered in its lane. Using cameras and sensors, the system detects lane markings on the road and gently steers the car if it starts to drift out of its lane without signaling. LKA provides subtle steering corrections to prevent unintentional lane departures, enhancing safety, especially during long highway drives or when driver attention wanes.</p>

                    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Adaptive Cruise Control <span class="text-body-secondary"></span></h2>
                    <p class="lead">Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a smart driving feature that automatically adjusts a car's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Unlike traditional cruise control, which maintains a set speed, ACC uses radar or cameras to monitor traffic conditions and slow down or accelerate as needed to keep a pre-set distance. It can brake or speed up the car based on the flow of traffic, providing a more relaxed driving experience.</p>

                    <p class="lead">A rearview camera, also known as a backup camera, is a safety feature in cars that provides a live video feed of the area directly behind the vehicle when reversing. The camera, typically mounted at the back, helps drivers see blind spots that mirrors might miss, making parking and maneuvering in tight spaces easier and safer. It often includes guidelines to assist with aligning the vehicle properly. Rearview cameras reduce the risk of accidents, especially by improving visibility of obstacles, pedestrians, or other vehicles while backing up.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Airbags are crucial safety devices in cars designed to protect occupants during collisions. They deploy instantly upon impact, inflating to cushion the driver and passengers, reducing the risk of serious injury by preventing direct contact with hard surfaces like the steering wheel, dashboard, or windows. Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple airbags, including front, side, and curtain airbags, providing comprehensive protection in various types of crashes.</p>
